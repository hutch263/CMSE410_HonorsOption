# CMSE410_HonorsOption

This project is meant to be a preclass assignment for later in CMSE 201 or beginning of CMSE 202. It covers what I think are the most important intro components of this class that would be accessible to a student at that stage of CMSE course, because I think these concepts are important and not everyone will get to take this class.
